# leksands-oudoor-workout
## SALES PITCH
The goal is to stay active outside the traditional methods.
Leksand is a found in the countryside in Sweden.It is very well known for its green forests, trails and perfect outdoors hence why i thought the name was befitting.Lek means play and land means country in Swedish .
The target will be the whole body for each workout in a playful and results evoking new style called Hiit(Hight Intensity Interval Training) .All these workouts can be done in the comfort of your home but if the weather allows, its better yet outdoors.
 Your body weight is the primary excercise tool .

 Responsive website feature for smaller screens for a screen as asmall as an iphone X

## FEATURES
### NAVIGATION BAR
I used the responsive bootstrap navigation bar because it allows for the menu bar to be reduced and expanded easily depending on the screen size being used .
In  smaller screens, I incooperated the hamburger icon that makes the text at the top disappear and is replaced by the three lines as is illuastrated above in the home page image.
### HOME PAGE
#### LOGO
my website's logo is a chain link that i put before every heading (h2) on each of the three pages <i class="fas fa-link">
I chose it because the chainlynk symbol symbolises strength.In this case, combining different styles to eleveate strength and conditioning  as i am going to illustrate later.
#### REASONS FOR WORKING OUT OUTSIDE
1.The format is such that I have all the reasons for working out coming first ,then quotes and social media in that order.In the social media section, the user can click on whichever media link they are most comfortable with to see what we and our members are about .(The icons don't lead to actual pages but rather the websites the icons represent)
 
 2.Initially I hade trouble finding a shade of text that would be visible against the dark forest background picture. So eventually i decided to add a  shadow effect with 0.6 opacity to bring out my white text. In my sign up page, I  used code similar to that of the code institute's love running tutorial website;specifically the sign up page.I  was able to implement the shadow effect into all my three pages.
 So at the the beginning of every container section from  the top of each page , I added the class of sign-up, to maintain uniformity.
 3.I added a hover effect alongside each reason to work out listed ,for UX to entice the user while they slide their mouse across the screen.

 #### QUOTES
1.I put in a hover feature as well that changes the font color to a red color to entice the casual reader to read the testimonies of people who have tried and succeded with these type of excercises.
 2. For smaller screens, I used bootsrap's responsive feature that altered the  visibility  of the two pictures on the quotes section so that there are no pictured for smaller hand helt devices but  just text.Below is an illustration:

 #### SOCIAL MEDIA
 1.Social media links to:
 faceebook, instagram , linkedin,pinterest ,twitter  and youtube.
 2.All media icons are clickable and open in a new page associated with the media icon.
 3.I also included a hover effect to enhance UX.
 
### ABOUT PAGE

1. This page goes deeper into details of what an outdoor workout routine would entail.Again this is regardless of location .With the entrace of the corona virus, alot of emphasis on keeping ones distance has made it such that anywhee you are is as good as you make it.
 2. I decided to divide the routines into 4 color coded(based on difficulty) sections with the help of battery icons at different percentage of usage to visualise how much intensity each program would entail.
 3. These excercises are entirely dependent on body weight and the patience of repetition to  guide the reader to results.
 4. The time that each person has available for working out everyday based on personal preference is for the user to decide and hence choose from the four categories.
5. to maximise on space , each of the color coded programs has a dropdown list of challenges styled with the help of bootstrap 5 that shows what each workout should entail.

 The about page is also responsive to different screen sizes with the help of bootstrap.

 ####coding challenge 
 i tried to use flex but on closer inspection not all the text was displaying on the mobile phone screen, I had trouble trying to solve this bug .
 
  ### JOIN THE MOVEMENT PAGE
![Screenshot (324)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83753891/131588066-2beef495-d94a-4d73-b272-9c06a0cdab89.png)
 The abave is a screenshot of my responsive join webpage. As metioned earlier,the code is inspired by the love running website from the tutorials that i thought were very effective  in getting one to join.The join page is essential to get more people to want to be a part of active lifestyle.
 The form is responsive and can only be entered successfully if the first name, second name and email are ALL entered .

 above the screenshot of how the join page would look like on a mobile device .
 
 ####  Features left to implement 
 1.In the future i would like to add animation to the chain link so that it stretches to enhance user experience and to strengthen the presence of my logo.
 2. To have more workout routines to include different interest groups for those who dont like the outdoors or just body weight challenges.

   #VALIDATOR TESTING
   I used the windows  dev tools to check the performance of the website . No issues were detected

   6.scroll back down to github pages to retrieve the link to the deployed pages.
  
 #CREDITS
 The structure of the webiste was inspired by the love runniing website created through code institute's tutorials.This is becuase my project targets a similar  topic of working out .

Instructions and imlemtation of the join the movement  page were taken from the love running website from code institutes instructionals tutorial. The target demographic of the highly popular excercise theme aligns with my intentions for this website.
